# Pomodoro planning

This document was created before any code was written.

The intention is to clarify the specifications, how I'll go about achieving them, my thought process, as well as any useful resources I may use or come back to throughout the process.

## Specifications:

### Basic functionality:

-   Setting a 25-minute timer for a task to be done.

-   Work on the task at hand for 25 minutes until the timer chimers.

-   Take a short break (typically for 5-10 minutes).

-   After four pomodoros, take a long break (15-20 minutes).

-   Great-looking visuals that are not distracting in any way.

-   Progress bar and a counter to count the number of Pomodoro.

-   Show off HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge.

## Steps:

0. Get design inspiration, choose a theme and colour palette
1. Write tests
2. Create the basic skeleton of the site
3. Implement buttons for basic functionality, hook up data etc.
4. Create progress bar, counter

## If there's time:

-   Cool animations (nothing too flashy)

-   Aria labels

-   Dark mode

-   Alarm sound choice

-   Customize pomodoro/break length

-   Ambience (rain/forest sounds/white noise)

-   Random motivational quote from API
